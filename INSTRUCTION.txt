1.In Python 2 print use as a statement and in program its syntax looks like print"Start learning python 2" to print some string.
  In Python 3 print use as a functions and in program its syntax looks like print("Start learning python 2") to print some string.

2.In Python 2, the implicit string type is ASCII, whereas, in Python 3, the implicit string type is Unicode.

3.There is small change made in Exception handling in Python 3. 'as' keyword is necessary to be used.
  We will discuss later in the Exception handling section.

4.The implicit string type is ASCII in python 2,whereas in Python 3, the implicit string type is Unicode.

5.The function raw_input() to accept the user's input in Python 2.It returns the string representing the value,which is typed by the user.
  To convert the string input into integer,we need to use the int() function in python. But In python 3 input() function which automatically 
  interpreted the type of input entered by the user.we can cast this value to any type by using primitive functions (int(), str(), etc.).
